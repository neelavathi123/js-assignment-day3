Difference between var, let and const with code examples.

. var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped.
. var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
. They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.
. While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.


//var

function nodeSimplified(){ 
  var a =10;   
  var a =20;   
  console.log(a);  //output 20 
}

//let

function nodeSimplified(){
  let a =10;
  let a =20; //throws syntax error
  console.log(a); 
}

//const

function nodeSimplified(){
  const MY_VARIABLE =10;
  console.log(MY_VARIABLE);  //output 10 
}
